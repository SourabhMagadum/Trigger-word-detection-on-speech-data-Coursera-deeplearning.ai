# Trigger-word-detection-on-speech-data-Coursera-deeplearning.ai
-In this assignment I learned about applying deep learning to speech recognition. 
- Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
- For this assignment, the trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
